# Online-Fraud-Detection
### Project Description:

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect online fraud. With the rise of online transactions, fraudsters are using various techniques to deceive people and organizations. Hence, there is a need to develop a system that can identify such fraudulent activities in real-time.

### The project will involve the following steps:

### 1. Data Collection: 
Collecting a large dataset of online transaction data from various sources such as credit card companies, e-commerce websites, and banks. The dataset should include both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

### 2.Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning and preprocessing the data by removing any missing values, duplicates, or irrelevant information.

### 3. Feature Engineering: 
Extracting relevant features from the dataset that can help in identifying fraudulent transactions. Some of the features that can be considered include transaction amount, transaction frequency, location, device information, and user behavior.

### 4. Model Selection:
Selecting an appropriate machine learning model for online fraud detection. Some of the commonly used models include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

### 5.Model Training: 
Training the selected model on the preprocessed dataset using appropriate techniques such as cross-validation, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning.

### 6. Model Evaluation: 
Evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
